<h1>Hi, I'm <b>Cheyenne B. Desmond</b></h1>
Lehigh University '28 - BS in Biostatistics & Health Data Science

My long term goal is to achieve a higher understanding of statsistical analysis in the context of health and its applications to disease prediction and judgement.
I hope to eventually work in industry and/or attend grad school for Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. :)
